## Project Description
We are MTLStudy, an E-Academy providing tutoring services to undergraduate students at any academic institution in Montreal. We primarily offer our services through our online transactional website. We employ a small number of full or part time tutors. We allow freelance tutors to offer services via our online platform as independent contractors. 

## Objective
Here goes the objectives of the project

## features
On our platform, tutors can sign up and set their own tutoring prices and the platform simply takes a cut from it. Tutors also have a complete online dashboard where they can chat with students, exchange documents and have voice/video calls. Administrators have dashboards to oversee the operation as a whole in terms of monitoring student and tutor activity. An administrative dashboard allows administrators to ban students and tutors, should they be in breach of platform policies. A final administrative dashboard is also available to administrators to get financial insight over the operation and find out if the platform is profitable.

There will be three distinct types of users, each with the following feature sets:
- Student
  - Generate study plan based on uploaded class schedule
  - Live chat with tutors
  - Access past exams with solutions 
  - Can rate tutors at the end of their service
- Tutor  
  - Video chat with students
  - Organize study plans for students 
  - Set their pricing, the site administrators take a cut
- Administrator 
  - Consult student and tutor files
  - Monitor student and tutor activity. Full control of all activity.
  - Consult administrative dashboards for costs, revenue, user activity, etc.
  - Moderation: ban students/tutors
